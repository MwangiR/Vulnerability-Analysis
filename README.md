# Vulnerability Analysis

## Introduction

This README provides detailed instructions for conducting vulnerability analysis using Git and associated tools. It outlines the steps required to examine fixing commits, identify vulnerabilities, and analyze code changes for security improvements.

## Preliminary Setup

Before beginning the analysis, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Validate repository links and fixing commits for assigned vulnerabilities.
2. Review the provided Git tutorial and refresh your understanding of Git commands.
3. Install Git if it is not already installed on your system.

## Cloning Repositories and Initial Setup

1. Clone or download assigned repositories to your local environment.
2. Familiarize yourself with Git commands relevant to the analysis tasks.
3. Understand the parameters associated with each command and their applicability to the analysis.

## Task Overview

### Task 3: Analyzing Fixing Commits

1. Study the fixing commit and its associated files for each assigned vulnerability.
2. Analyze deleted and added lines separately.
3. Use `git blame` to trace the history of deleted lines and identify the latest modifying commit.
4. Determine the enclosing scope for added lines and utilize relevant code snippets.
5. Employ `git blame` to identify the latest commits affecting added lines.

### Task 4: Exploring Git Blame Parameters

1. Learn about the parameters available in `git blame` and their impact on analysis.
2. Experiment with different parameters to observe variations in Vulnerability Contributing Changes (VCCs).
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of each parameter in providing meaningful insights.

### Task 6: Analyzing Fixing Commits and VCCs

1. Focus on the fixing commit and associated Vulnerability Contributing Changes (VCCs).
2. Use `git log` and `git show` to extract relevant information regarding the fixing commit.
3. Identify keywords/phrases indicative of vulnerabilities or special requests.
4. Document findings and insights derived from the analysis.

## Reporting

1. Document your analysis process thoroughly.
2. Fill in the provided Excel file with relevant information.
3. Compile a comprehensive report summarizing your findings and observations.
4. Submit both the report and Excel file for evaluation.

## Conclusion

This README serves as a professional guide for conducting vulnerability analysis using Git. By following the outlined steps and leveraging Git tools effectively, you can gain valuable insights into vulnerabilities and contribute to enhancing code security. Should you encounter any challenges during the analysis, seek assistance from your team or relevant resources. Good luck with your analysis!
